## Installation 
To install, you can clone the project:
```
git clone git@github.com:jwc20/fcis-api.git

## Usage

### Create client for searching accident reports

You can use description, abstract, and keyword words to search the reports.
Note that "abstract" served the same purpose as "description" for older reports.

```
import fcis

desc = ["employee"]
abst = ["employee"]
keyw = ["fire"]

client = fcis.FCIS(descriptions=desc, keywords=keyw)
```

### Scrape accident reports

```
reports = client.get_accidents(p_show=100)
print(reports)
```

And you will get:

```
[{'accident_id': '141245.015',
  'summary_url': 'https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/accidentsearch.accident_detail?id=141245.015',
